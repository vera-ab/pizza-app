# Django Project with PostgreSQL Database and Many-to-Many Relations

This repository contains a Django project with a PostgreSQL database and models that utilize many-to-many relations. This README file provides information on how to set up and run the project.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python (version 3.6 or later)
- Django (version 3.0 or later)
- PostgreSQL (version 10 or later)

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the project files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended).

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a PostgreSQL database for the project. You can use the `createdb` command-line tool or a PostgreSQL GUI client.

   ```bash
   createdb django_project
   ```

5. Configure the database settings in the project's `settings.py` file. Update the following settings with your PostgreSQL database details:

   ```python
   DATABASES = {
       'default': {
           'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
           'NAME': 'django_project',
           'USER': '<database-user>',
           'PASSWORD': '<database-password>',
           'HOST': 'localhost',
           'PORT': '5432',
       }
   }
   ```

6. Apply the database migrations to create the required tables.

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

7. Create a superuser account to access the Django admin panel.

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

8. Start the development server.

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

9. Open a web browser and access the project at `http://localhost:8000/`. The Django admin panel is available at `http://localhost:8000/admin/`.

## Project Structure

The project follows the standard Django project structure with additional files and folders:

- `manage.py`: A command-line utility for interacting with the project.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing all the Python dependencies required for the project.
- `project/`: The main project folder.
  - `settings.py`: The project's settings file, including database configuration and installed apps.
  - `urls.py`: The project's URL configuration.
- `app/`: An example Django app included in the project.
  - `models.py`: Contains the database models, including many-to-many relations.
  - `views.py`: Contains the views for handling HTTP requests.
  - `urls.py`: Contains the URL routing for the app.
  - `templates/`: Folder for HTML templates used by the app.
  - `migrations/`: Folder containing database migration files.

## Usage

You can modify the existing models in the `app/models.py` file or create new models to suit your project's requirements. Make sure to update the database schema by creating and applying migrations whenever you make changes to the models.

To explore and manage the models and their data, you can use the Django admin panel. Log in with the superuser account created in step 7 of the setup process.

You can also customize the app's views and templates to create the desired functionality and user interface.

## Conclusion

This Django project provides a starting point for building web applications with a PostgreSQL database and models that utilize many-to-many relations. Feel free to customize and extend the project to
